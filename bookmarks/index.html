{% include header.html %}

<div class="post">

    Often times, I don't remember why I bookmarked something in the first place.
    This is my attempt at organizing.
    {% assign bookmarks = site.posts | where_exp: "post", "post.category == 'bookmark'"%}
    {% for post in bookmarks %}
    <p>

    <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> <span class="date">{{ post.date | date: "%-m/%-d"}}</span>

    </p>
    {%endfor%}
    <p class=comments>

    </p>

</div>
