## RSS

This blog delivers updates via [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). To use it, you need _a reader_.

1. Register at one of the services or install an app. Good list of hosted RSS readers and apps can be found [here](https://zapier.com/blog/best-rss-feed-reader-apps/).
2. Add my blog to the sources. Usually "`kistanov.dev`" would work, but if it doesn't, try this: "`http://kistanov.dev/blog/atom.xml`"
3. Enjoy!
