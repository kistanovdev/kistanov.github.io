While learning more about Networking and Protocols, I pulled out Wireshark and started inspecting some packets and saw a load of packets marked as mDNS.

Apparently, it's a pretty handy protocol that allows to resolve hostnames to IP addresses within small networks. RFC 6762 for reference.

So how does it work?
