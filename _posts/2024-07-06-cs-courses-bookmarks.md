Over the years, I've found a collection of CS Courses I learned from.
Some I've watched completely, some I've skimmed through.


# InfoSec

##### [CS6038/CS5138 Malware Analysis, UC](https://class.malware.re/)
I have yet to take this course completely. So far it seems interesting
and challenging for somebody who doesn't have a good background in InfoSec.

#### [Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)
This course has helped me a lot during college. If you have industry experience,
you won't learn much. However, if you're still in your 3rd/4th year of college
you will find this material very valuable.

#### Web Security

[Website Link](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs253/). It's my goal to finish up this course completely.
I've skimmed through and am familiar with some topics.
