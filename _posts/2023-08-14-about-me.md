My name is Daniil Kistanov. I was born in Russia, lived a bit in Kazakhstan and moved to US in 2014.

I enjoy Computer Science and good movies.

I suffer from a serious condition callled _link hoarding_. It's one of the lighter forms
of [digital hoarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_hoarding). You can check my wiki page up top
to verify how bad the condition has gotten.
