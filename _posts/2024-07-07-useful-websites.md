## [Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/prologue/foreword.html)
The only way to learn is to build something yourself. Try to go through this course and you will
have a better understanding of the way Linux works.

## [Django Con 2023](https://www.youtube.com/@DjangoConEurope/videos)
I probably won't ever watch all the videos from here, but I'd like to keep this here as
a reminder to come back.

## [C Gibberish to English](https://cdecl.org/)
An amazing website to convert complicated C declarations into English.


## [Anki for CS](https://www.gresearch.com/news/anki-as-learning-superpower-computer-science-edition/)
I don't remember why I bookmarked this, but it was probably important. Will
come back to this at some point.


## [A knowledgebase](https://github.com/trimstray/the-book-of-secret-knowledge)
Honestly, stuff like this may overwhelm you. The way I learn concepts 
the best is I just stumble onto them again and again. 

## [AWS Flashcards](https://cloudbite.attejuvonen.fi/?deck=aws&card=-1300882318)
Honestly, to hell with AWS. Still, this is kinda fun to learn.

## [Structuring a Python project](https://pycon.switowski.com/03-project-structure-2-parts/structure/)
When I work with python, it's kinda hard to structure the project properly.
It isn't like Java, where you have a rigid system.
This guide helped me learn better ways.
