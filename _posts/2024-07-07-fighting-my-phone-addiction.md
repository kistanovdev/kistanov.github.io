I used to average at least 5-6 hours a day on my phone.
Over the past few months I was able to get my time to below 2 hours a day.
Here's a list of the things that helped me:

### Don't bring your phone to work
I only bring Apple Watch to work. I can still keep in touch with family
in case of an emergency.

### Turn off all notifications
Left only essential notifications. Looking at red dots
and notification dumps is a toll on my attention span.
We shouldn't allow every app on our phone to bug us
when they want.

### Mute conversations
I don't need to get pinged about every conversation
that's happening in iMessage or Telegram. Used the "Mute Conversation"
feature more often.

### Reset home screen, delete unused Apps
Warning: don't get mad at me if you do this without understanding
what you're about to do.
Went to `Settings -> General -> Reset -> Reset Homescreen layout`.
Once rearranged, I deleted all the apps I no longer use or haven't
opened in over 3-4 months.

### No Apps Home screen
I only have Phone Settings and Watch settings app visible on my 
home screen.
