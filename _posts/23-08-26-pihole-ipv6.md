summary: "How to make Pihole work with IPV6"

I run a [pihole](https://pi-hole.net/) instance on my local Wi-Fi to block ads on the DNS level.
It's been running very smooth, but when I was tinkering with my local setup, I noticed
that IPv6 wasn't enabled. So, I enabled it. It's not the first time I completely nuked my Wi-Fi 
and had to figure out what is going on.

This time, instead of resetting the router to default settings, I decided to do some debugging.

```bash
ssh pihole.local
```

I am running [unbound](https://unbound.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/en/latest/use-cases/home-resolver.html),
custom DNS resolver that doesn't rely on Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) or Google (0.0.0.0).

First step in debugging is to figure out if DNS queries go out at all.
Here, we're running a DNS query but telling `dig` to use IPv6 and specify the DNS resolver with the @ sign.
```
dig AAAA ipv6.google.com @127.0.0.1
```


This resulted in a failure. 

What I learned is that unbound needs a config change to allow for IPv6.

```
sudo vim /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/pi-hole.conf
```

The config should have these fields set.

```
interface: ::1
do-ip6: yes
```
Now
```
sudo service unbound start
```

and voil√°.
