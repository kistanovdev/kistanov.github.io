 leads to the evidence of my team's "stellar" performance for 2nd division of ICPC. 
 
During college I've 
 participated in some competitive programming contests. `2019 Pacific Northwest Regional Contest` was 
 my best performance to date. It was a good mix of problems, 2 them we solved by doing a good pair
 programming session. My teammate Steve knew how to solve it in his head, but it would take more 
 time writing it in his preferred language C. I was able to use his instructions and some python
 magic to come up with a solution.
 

These challenges don't exactly reflect your Software Engineering skills, but I found that
the guys who performed the best at ICPC at my college all got hired by top companies without exceptions.
