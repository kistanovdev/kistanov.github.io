Recently I finished up a project at my work 
and I needed to verify that all of the work was done correctly.


The verification was slow and sometimes would break. That moment
I realized that I could keep doing my work but just add a bunch of 
`say` commands to notify me during the script execution if something went wrong. 
I recommend it a lot.

```bash
man say
NAME
       say - Convert text to audible speech

```
